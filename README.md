# Personal-Diary-Management
It's a simple program of 'C' with I/O. Which will help you to manage your personal diary. 

Don't through diary.txt out of the folder. Because it might not created by this program. 
If you want to create if the .txt file, then you have to edit the program. just open the file 
'w+' mode. 

Then, It will do one thing. That is, if file not exits then create it.

Happy Coding  :)
